1. xmlhttps

Redierection in React
--------------------

react-router-dom - library used for redierection 


Three components for routing:

                            BrowserRouter - root component selector
                            Route - for path setting
                            Routes - if we use more than one path

useParams - hook used to access params 






        REDUX
        -----

        Props Drilling - data will stuck in any intermediate component when the component have any issues

                       - props drilling occures during Coupling (Many connection between parent and child)

                       - to avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all components independent

                       - so react introduce a state management technology - REDUX
